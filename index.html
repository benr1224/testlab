<p>I was born in Bryn Mawr, P.A. which is just outside Philadelphia
<br> Being a dual major in both the iSchool and Whitman, I get the best of both words as I learn about the intersection of technology and business.
<br> I am currently on the men's ultimate frisbee team here at Syracuse and have met many of my friends through the team </p>
